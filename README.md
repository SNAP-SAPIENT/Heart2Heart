# Heart2Heart
Wearable wireless platform to connect two people by their heart beats.

Feeling connected to someone far away once required the act of writing a message and hoping the note found its way to the intended recipient. But physical means of communication eventually gave way to digital ways. Have instantaneous emoticons brought us closer to our loved ones? No.

Equipping two people with sensors that receive and transmit heartbeat data will create a subtle, realtime sensation of the other’s well being. Physically feeling another person’s heartbeat via subtle vibrations creates a persistent, subconscious bond able of detecting irregularities in heart rate, moments of excitement, or physical ailments.
